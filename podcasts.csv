Le Mâle du Siècle,"L’évolution de la société déstabilise fondamentalement le rôle des hommes. Depuis l’enfance, les hommes sont bombardés d’injonctions: sois comme-ci, sois comme ça, les hommes ça ne pleurent pas.  Beaucoup d’hommes sont déboussolés. On les accuse aujourd’hui  d’être le Mal du Siècle. Les dirigeants et chefs d’entreprises sont en première ligne : leur valeur sociale est liée à la  valeur de leur société.  En gros “Dis moi quel est ton EBITDA, je te dirais qui tu es”.

Randy Travis - Audio Biography,"Randy Travis: The Country Legend's Inspiring Journey and Groundbreaking AI Collaboration Introduction: Randy Travis, born Randy Bruce Traywick on May 4, 1959, is an American country music singer, songwriter, and actor. Known for his distinctive baritone voice and traditional country sound, Travis has been a prominent figure in the country music industry since the 1980s. Throughout his career, he has released numerous successful albums, earned several awards, and left an indelible mark on the genre. However, a life-changing stroke in 2013 left him unable to speak or sing properly, putting his musical career on hold. In a groundbreaking new project, Travis has now released a new song, ""Where That Came From,"" using AI technology to recreate his iconic voice. Early Life and Career Beginnings: Randy Travis was born in Marshville, North Carolina, to Harold and Bobbie Traywick. Growing up in a working-class family, Travis was exposed to country music at a young age and began playing guitar and singing as a child. In his teenage years, he faced several legal issues and dropped out of high school, but his passion for music never wavered. In 1978, Travis moved to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career in country music. He initially struggled to find success, working odd jobs and performing in local clubs. However, his fortunes changed when he was discovered by Elizabeth Hatcher, a music industry veteran who became his manager and later his wife. With Hatcher's guidance, Travis signed with Warner Bros. Records in 1985 and released his debut album, ""Storms of Life,"" the following year. Rise to Fame and Success: ""Storms of Life"" was a massive success, selling over three million copies and establishing Travis as a major force in country music. The album's blend of traditional country sound and Travis' powerful, emotive vocals resonated with audiences and critics alike. Hit singles like ""1982,"" ""On the Other Hand,"" and ""Diggin' Up Bones"" helped cement his status as a rising star. Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, Travis continued to release successful albums and singles, such as ""Always & Forever"" (1987), ""Old 8×10"" (1988), and ""Heroes & Friends"" (1990). His music showcased his deep respect for country music's roots while also appealing to a broad audience. Travis' success played a significant role in the neo-traditionalist movement in country music, which sought to return the genre to its traditional sound and values. In addition to his music career, Travis also ventured into acting, appearing in several films and television shows, including ""The Rainmaker"" (1997) and ""Texas Rangers"" (2001). His acting roles often showcased his natural charisma and down-to-earth personality. Personal Struggles and Stroke: Despite his professional success, Travis faced personal challenges throughout his life. He struggled with alcohol addiction and had several run-ins with the law, including arrests for public intoxication and driving under the influence. In 2010, he and Elizabeth Hatcher divorced after 19 years of marriage. In July 2013, Travis suffered a life-threatening stroke that left him in a coma for several days. The stroke, combined with a severe case of pneumonia, led to a lengthy hospital stay and months of rehabilitation. As a result of the stroke, Travis lost the ability to speak and sing properly, effectively putting his music career on hold. The Road to Recovery and AI Collaboration: In the years following his stroke, Travis focused on his recovery and rehabilitation. With the support of his family, friends, and fans, he made significant progress in regaining his physical and cognitive abilities. Although he remained unable to sing, Travis continued to make public appearances and remained a beloved figure in the country music community. In 2023, a groundbreaking collaboration between Travis, his long-time producer Kyle Lehning, and Warner Music Group brought new hope for the country legend's musical legacy. Using cutting-edge AI technology, they set out to create a new Randy Travis song, despite his inability to sing. The process began with 42 of Travis' vocal-isolated recordings, which were used to train an unnamed AI model. Under the supervision of Travis and Lehning, fellow country singer James DuPre recorded the vocals for the new song, ""Where That Came From."" The AI model then transformed DuPre's vocals to sound like Travis' iconic voice. The result is a heartwarming, sentimental tune that captures the essence of Travis' music and showcases the potential of AI in music production. ""Where That Came From"" marks Travis' first new song since his stroke in 2013 and has been met with enthusiasm and emotional responses from fans and the music industry alike. Legacy and Impact: Randy Travis' impact on country music cannot be overstated. His distinctive voice, traditional sound, and heartfelt lyrics have influenced countless artists and helped shape the genre's direction. Travis has sold over 25 million albums, earned seven Grammy Awards, and been inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame (2016) and the Grand Ole Opry (2017). Beyond his musical achievements, Travis' personal struggles and resilience have also inspired many. His journey from a small-town boy to a country music superstar, his battles with addiction, and his remarkable recovery from a life-changing stroke have all served as a testament to his strength and determination. The groundbreaking AI collaboration that brought ""Where That Came From"" to life not only offers a glimpse into the future of music production but also serves as a heartwarming tribute to Travis' enduring legacy. It showcases the power of technology to preserve and celebrate an artist's voice and the enduring impact of their music. As Randy Travis continues to recover and inspire others with his story, his contributions to country music and his indomitable spirit will forever be remembered and cherished by fans around the world. The release of ""Where That Came From"" marks a new chapter in his remarkable journey and a testament to the enduring power of music to heal, unite, and inspire.

Prom!,"The History of Proms: A Timeless Tradition Proms, short for ""promenade dances,"" have been a beloved tradition in American high school culture for over a century. The event has evolved significantly since its inception, reflecting the changing social norms, fashion trends, and music styles of each era. From its humble beginnings as a simple dance to its current status as an extravagant celebration, the history of proms is a fascinating journey through time. Early Origins and Inspiration The concept of proms can be traced back to the late 19th century when American universities and colleges began hosting formal dances for their students. These events were inspired by the European tradition of debutante balls, where young women from wealthy families were presented to society as they reached marriageable age. The dances were seen as opportunities for young people to socialize, make new acquaintances, and perhaps even find suitable marriage partners. In the early 1900s, high schools started to adopt the idea of hosting their own formal dances. These events were initially called ""senior hops"" or ""senior receptions"" and were typically held in the school gymnasium or auditorium. The dances were relatively simple affairs, with decorations often limited to streamers and balloons. Live music was provided by local bands or orchestras, and refreshments were usually served. 1920s and 1930s: The Birth of the Modern Prom The term ""prom"" first appeared in the 1920s, likely derived from the word ""promenade,"" which refers to a leisurely walk or stroll. During this time, proms became more elaborate and formal, with students dressing up in their finest attire and dancing to the latest jazz and swing music. The events were often held in hotel ballrooms or country clubs, adding to the air of sophistication and elegance. The Great Depression of the 1930s had a significant impact on proms. Many schools were forced to scale back their events due to financial constraints, and some even canceled their proms altogether. However, the tradition persevered, and students found creative ways to keep the spirit of the prom alive. Some schools held ""poverty proms,"" where students wore homemade or secondhand clothes, while others hosted potluck dinners instead of elaborate banquets. 1940s and 1950s: The Golden Age of Proms Following World War II, the United States entered a period of prosperity and optimism, which was reflected in the prom culture of the time. Proms became more extravagant than ever, with students going all out to create memorable experiences. The events were often themed, with popular motifs including ""Enchantment Under the Sea"" and ""Moonlight Serenade."" Decorations became more elaborate, featuring twinkling lights, fountains, and even live animals. Fashion also played a significant role in the proms of the 1940s and 1950s. Girls typically wore long, formal gowns with full skirts and cinched waists, while boys donned tuxedos or suits with bow ties. Corsages and boutonnieres were a must-have accessory, with boys presenting their dates with flowers to wear on their wrists or pinned to their dresses. Music and dancing were the centerpieces of the prom experience during this era. Big band music gave way to the new sounds of rock and roll, with artists like Chuck Berry, Little Richard, and Elvis Presley dominating the airwaves. The prom dance floor was the place to showcase the latest moves, from the jitterbug to the twist. 1960s and 1970s: The Era of Change The social and political upheaval of the 1960s and 1970s had a profound impact on prom culture. Many students began to reject the formal traditions of the past, opting for more casual and individualistic approaches to the event. Some schools even abandoned the prom altogether, replacing it with alternative celebrations like ""senior week"" or ""grad night."" For those who still attended proms, fashion choices reflected the changing times. Girls favored shorter hemlines, bold colors, and more revealing styles, while boys experimented with colorful tuxedos and ruffled shirts. The influence of the hippie movement could be seen in the popularity of floral prints, bellbottoms, and long, flowing hair. Music at proms also underwent a transformation during this period. The sounds of Motown, folk rock, and psychedelic rock replaced the more traditional big band and swing music of earlier decades. Bands like The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and The Beach Boys became prom staples, with students dancing the night away to their favorite tunes. 1980s and 1990s: The Era of Excess The 1980s and 1990s saw a resurgence of interest in proms, with the events becoming more elaborate and expensive than ever before. The influence of popular culture, particularly movies like ""Pretty in Pink"" and ""She's All That,"" helped to cement the prom's status as a quintessential high school experience. Fashion in the 1980s was all about excess, with girls favoring poofy, ruffled dresses in bright colors and bold patterns. Boys often sported colorful cummerbunds and bow ties to match their dates' dresses. The 1990s saw a shift towards sleeker, more minimalist styles, with girls opting for slim-fitting gowns in muted tones and boys favoring classic black tuxedos. Music at proms in the 1980s and 1990s reflected the diverse tastes of the era. The 1980s were dominated by pop, rock, and new wave acts like Madonna, Duran Duran, and Bon Jovi, while the 1990s saw the rise of grunge, hip hop, and boy bands like Nirvana, The Notorious B.I.G., and *NSYNC. The 21st Century: Proms in the Modern Era In the 21st century, proms have continued to evolve and adapt to changing times. Technology has played an increasingly important role, with students using social media to document their prom experiences and share photos and videos with friends and family. Online shopping has also made it easier than ever for students to find the perfect prom attire, with a wide range of styles and price points available at the click of a button. Fashion at modern proms is highly diverse, with students drawing inspiration from a variety of sources, including celebrity red carpet looks, vintage styles, and cultural traditions. Girls may opt for anything from a classic ball gown to a sleek, form-fitting dress, while boys may choose a traditional tuxedo or a more modern, slim-fit suit. Music at contemporary proms is similarly eclectic, with students dancing to a mix of current pop hits, classic rock and roll, and timeless slow jams. DJs have largely replaced live bands as the preferred musical entertainment, allowing for a wider range of songs and genres to be played throughout the night. Despite the many changes that proms have undergone over the years, the core elements of the event have remained largely the same. Proms are still a time for students to dress up, dance, and celebrate the end of their high school years with friends and classmates. For many, the prom represents a rite of passage, a moment to reflect on the past and look forward to the future. Prom Traditions and Customs Throughout the history of proms, certain traditions and customs have emerged that have become integral to the prom experience. These traditions vary from school to school and region to region but often include: 1. Promposals: In recent years, the act of asking someone to prom has become an event in itself, with students going to great lengths to create elaborate and creative ""promposals"" to impress their potential dates. 2. Prom Court: Many schools select a prom court, consisting of a prom king and queen and their attendants. The court is typically chosen by popular vote and is crowned during a ceremony at the prom. 3. Prom Themes: Schools often choose a theme for their prom, which influences the decorations, invitations, and overall atmosphere of the event. Popular themes include ""A Night in Paris,"" ""Masquerade Ball,"" and ""The Great Gatsby."" 4. Pre-Prom Events: Before the main event, many students attend pre-prom gatherings, such as group dinners or photo sessions. These events provide an opportunity for friends to socialize and capture memories before the dance. 5. After-Prom Parties: Some schools organize after-prom parties as a way to provide a safe and supervised environment for students to continue the celebration. These parties may include activities like games, movies, and food. The Significance of Proms Beyond being a fun and memorable event, proms hold a deeper significance for many students. For some, the prom represents a milestone in their personal growth and development, a moment to reflect on their high school years and the relationships they've formed. For others, the prom is an opportunity to express their individuality and creativity through their choice of attire, accessories, and dance moves. Proms can also serve as a unifying force, bringing together students from different social circles and backgrounds. The shared experience of dressing up, dancing, and celebrating creates a sense of camaraderie and belonging that can last long after the event is over. Moreover, proms have played a role in shaping popular culture and have been featured in countless movies, TV shows, and songs. The iconic image of the prom queen and king, the slow dance to a romantic ballad, and the drama of prom night have become ingrained in the American cultural consciousness.

La Folie d'Entreprendre,"""C'est folie d'entreprendre plus qu'on ne peut."" Par ces mots, Ismène signifie à sa soeur Antigone qu'elle ne devrait pas chercher à braver les ordres du nouveau roi de Thèbes, leur oncle Cléonte, pour atteindre ses objectifs et répondre à un besoin supérieur. Elle s'exposerait ainsi aux pires châtiments. Loin de Sophocle et de l'Athènes de l'âge d'or, les entrepreneurs de notre époque se mettent eux aussi en danger, souvent à l'encontre des recommendations de leurs proches, collègues et amis. Financièrement d'abord, mais surtout physiologiquement et psychologiquement. Pourquoi aller ainsi au combat, au risque de déséquilibres parfois irrémédiables et de conséquences graves sur sa vie propre et celle de son entourage ? Qu'est-qui meut ces guerriers d'un nouveau genre, les pousse à continuer à entreprendre malgré les obstacles, les maux et les échecs ? C'est l'objet de ce podcast. Nos échanges se fondent sur plus de quinze années passées à côtoyer des entrepreneurs, investir dans leurs projets, les accompagner dans leur recherche de croissance, et les former aux rudiments de leur nouveau métier. Mais aussi une expérience plus intime via mes propres projets entrepreneuriaux, et un Doctorate in Business Administration qui m'ouvre les portes de la recherche la plus aboutie sur ce sujet d'actualité.

Close Minded Podcast,"“Close Minded? Isn't that sort of narrow and negative?”  At first glance, that's certainly a reasonable reaction. (But it got your attention, didn't it?) However, the name of the show is not just a marketing tactic, but rooted in a deep truth.  G.K. Chesterton once wrote the following:  “Merely having an open mind is nothing. The object of opening the mind, as of opening the mouth, is to shut it again on something solid.”  A hallmark of maturity is the ability to hold up an idea you don't necessarily agree with and scrutinize it, to evaluate it dispassionately without having to own it for yourself.   Another sign of maturity is one's willingness to engage a wide variety of ideas and topics without being frightened away just because someone shouts “problematic!”–whether it be a Twitter mob, a self-hating Social Justice Warrior on Facebook, or even your own tribe.   So around here we aren't afraid to discuss lots of ideas, regardless of our actual positions:   Political anarchism? Check. Human sexuality? Check. Trump as an existential dictatorial threat to Western Civilization? Check. Darwinism and Intelligent Design? Check. The intersection of technology and philosophy? Check.   But there's more! We also aren't interested in claims that certain genres of literature are “uncool.” Who cares?   We are readers. Avid readers of wide-ranging works. Readers who cultivate what Tolkien called “the leaf mold” of the mind, the topsoil of our moral imagination and creativity.   We aren't embarrassed to enjoy “kid lit” and YA fiction, or afraid to read sociological & political works that challenge our assumptions. We enjoy classic novels, hard-boiled crime thrillers, controversial works of theology & culture, economics, productivity & personal development. We are not bound by social or political convention.   We “read for pleasure in an age of distraction” (Alan Jacobs). We consume and engage books for stimulation, conviction & enrichment. We want to stretch our minds, grow in empathy, & experience the joys & challenges of reading good books.   We read with an open mind in order to close it on something.  --------------------------------  “But wait! Shouldn't it be CloseD Minded (with a d)?”  Welcome, fellow grammar nerd, to my tortured existence. I do happen to believe that “Closed Minded” is preferable to “Close Minded”–and thus, I die a little bit inside each time I say or write it. HOWEVER, I went with “Close Minded” for two reasons. First, technically both are considered acceptable–see here and here. Second, when I compared the Google search results for both spellings, “Close” had exponentially more hits, so I followed the basic rules of internet marketing and went with what people are actually searching for.  Case close, er, closed.

Dr. Dre - Audio Biography,"Andre Romelle Young, better known by his stage name Dr. Dre, is an American rapper, record producer, and entrepreneur who has left an indelible mark on the world of hip-hop and popular culture. Born on February 18, 1965, in Compton, California, Dre grew up in a neighborhood plagued by poverty, gang violence, and racial tension. Despite the challenges he faced, Dre found solace in music and began his journey to becoming one of the most influential figures in the history of rap. Early Life and Career Beginnings: Dre's love for music began at an early age. As a teenager, he frequented local clubs and parties, where he was exposed to the emerging hip-hop scene. Inspired by the likes of Grandmaster Flash and Afrika Bambaataa, Dre started experimenting with DJing and producing beats. In 1984, he joined the electro-hop group World Class Wreckin' Cru, which gained local popularity and helped establish Dre's reputation as a talented DJ and producer. N.W.A and the Birth of Gangsta Rap: In 1986, Dre met rapper Ice Cube, and together they formed the groundbreaking group N.W.A (Niggaz Wit Attitudes) with fellow rappers Eazy-E, MC Ren, and DJ Yella. N.W.A's debut album, ""Straight Outta Compton"" (1988), was a raw and unapologetic portrayal of life in the inner city, touching on themes of police brutality, gang violence, and social inequality. The album's explicit lyrics and confrontational style sparked controversy and drew criticism from politicians and media outlets, but it also resonated deeply with young audiences who appreciated its authenticity and rebellious spirit. ""Straight Outta Compton"" is widely regarded as a landmark album that defined the genre of gangsta rap and paved the way for the rise of West Coast hip-hop. Dre's production on the album, characterized by its heavy basslines, funky samples, and hard-hitting beats, set a new standard for hip-hop production and influenced countless artists in the years to come. Solo Career and ""The Chronic"": In the early 1990s, tensions within N.W.A led to the group's disbandment, and Dre embarked on a solo career. He founded Death Row Records with Suge Knight and released his debut solo album, ""The Chronic,"" in 1992. The album marked a significant shift in Dre's musical style, incorporating elements of G-funk (a subgenre of hip-hop characterized by smooth, melodic beats and heavy use of synthesizers) and showcasing his growth as a producer and rapper. ""The Chronic"" was a massive commercial and critical success, debuting at number three on the Billboard 200 chart and earning Dre a Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance. The album's hit singles, including ""Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang"" and ""Let Me Ride,"" became cultural touchstones and solidified Dre's status as a hip-hop icon. Aftermath Entertainment and Eminem: In 1996, Dre left Death Row Records and founded Aftermath Entertainment, a label that would become a driving force in hip-hop for years to come. One of Dre's most significant contributions to the music industry during this period was his discovery and mentorship of rapper Eminem. Dre signed Eminem to Aftermath in 1998 and produced his debut album, ""The Slim Shady LP"" (1999), which launched Eminem's career and established him as one of the most controversial and talented rappers of his generation. Dre's collaboration with Eminem continued with the production of ""The Marshall Mathers LP"" (2000) and ""The Eminem Show"" (2002), both of which were critical and commercial successes and further cemented Dre's reputation as a hitmaker and talent scout. ""2001"" and Later Productions: In 1999, Dre released his second solo album, ""2001"" (also known as ""Dr. Dre 2001""), which featured a star-studded lineup of guest artists, including Eminem, Snoop Dogg, and Xzibit. The album showcased Dre's evolution as a producer, incorporating more live instrumentation and experimenting with different musical styles. Hit singles like ""Still D.R.E."" and ""Forgot About Dre"" reaffirmed his dominance in the rap world and introduced his music to a new generation of fans. Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, Dre continued to produce and collaborate with a wide range of artists, including 50 Cent, The Game, Kendrick Lamar, and Anderson .Paak. His production work on albums like 50 Cent's ""Get Rich or Die Tryin'"" (2003) and Kendrick Lamar's ""good kid, m.A.A.d city"" (2012) helped shape the sound of modern hip-hop and earned him widespread acclaim from critics and fans alike. Entrepreneurship and Beats Electronics: In addition to his music career, Dre has also made a name for himself as a successful entrepreneur. In 2006, he co-founded Beats Electronics with record executive Jimmy Iovine, launching a line of premium headphones and audio equipment. The company's flagship product, Beats by Dr. Dre headphones, quickly became a cultural phenomenon, endorsed by celebrities and athletes and coveted by consumers worldwide. In 2014, Apple acquired Beats Electronics for $3 billion, making Dre one of the richest figures in the music industry. The acquisition also brought Dre and Iovine to Apple, where they took on executive roles and played a key part in the development of Apple Music, the company's streaming service. Legacy and Influence: Dr. Dre's impact on the world of hip-hop cannot be overstated. As a rapper, producer, and entrepreneur, he has shaped the sound and culture of the genre for over three decades, inspiring countless artists and leaving a lasting legacy that continues to resonate with audiences around the world. As a producer, Dre is known for his meticulous attention to detail, his innovative use of sampling and synthesizers, and his ability to craft beats that are both commercially appealing and artistically groundbreaking. His work on albums like ""The Chronic"" and ""2001"" redefined the sound of West Coast hip-hop and set a new standard for production quality in the genre. As a rapper, Dre is renowned for his smooth flow, his clever wordplay, and his ability to paint vivid pictures of life in the streets of Los Angeles. His lyrics often reflect on the struggles and triumphs of his own life, offering a raw and honest perspective on the realities of growing up in the inner city. Beyond his individual contributions, Dre has also played a crucial role in launching the careers of some of the most successful and influential artists in hip-hop history. From Snoop Dogg and Eminem to 50 Cent and Kendrick Lamar, Dre has a proven track record of discovering and nurturing talent, helping to shape the future of the genre and leaving a lasting impact on the music industry as a whole. In recognition of his contributions to music and popular culture, Dre has been honored with numerous awards and accolades throughout his career. He has won six Grammy Awards, including Best Rap Album for ""The Chronic"" and Producer of the Year (Non-Classical) in 2001. He has also been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of N.W.A, cementing his place in music history. Personal Life and Philanthropy: Despite his success and influence, Dre has also faced his share of personal struggles and controversies over the years. He has been open about his past involvement with gangs and his battles with substance abuse, using his music as a means of processing and reflecting on these experiences. In recent years, Dre has also been involved in various philanthropic efforts, particularly in the areas of education and community development. In 2013, he and Jimmy Iovine donated $70 million to the University of Southern California to establish the USC Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young Academy for Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation, a program designed to nurture the next generation of entrepreneurs and innovators. Dr. Dre recently opened up about a serious health scare he experienced in 2021. While hospitalized for a brain aneurysm, he revealed he actually suffered three strokes during that two-week period. This came as a shock to the music legend, who said he maintains a healthy lifestyle. He even questioned if he could have prevented it by working out more, but doctors assured him it was likely hereditary. The experience left a big impact on Dr. Dre. He expressed a newfound appreciation for life and acknowledged the unpredictable nature of such health events. Conclusion: Dr. Dre's story is one of perseverance, innovation, and artistic excellence. From his humble beginnings in Compton to his status as a global icon and business mogul, Dre has left an indelible mark on the world of music and popular culture. His contributions as a rapper, producer, and entrepreneur have shaped the sound and direction of hip-hop for over three decades, inspiring countless artists and fans around the world. As Dre continues to evolve and adapt in an ever-changing industry, his legacy as one of the most influential and successful figures in the history of hip-hop remains secure. His music, his vision, and his entrepreneurial spirit will continue to inspire and influence generations of artists and innovators to come, cementing his place as a true icon of American culture. In a career spanning more than three decades, Dr. Dre has proven himself to be a visionary artist, a savvy businessman, and a cultural trailblazer. His impact on the world of music and beyond is immeasurable, and his story serves as a testament to the power of creativity, hard work, and determination.

MUSIC 3.0 - Menschen - Marken - Metaverse,"Dreht sich in Deiner Welt alles um die Musik? Bist Du selbst Musiker, Songwriter, Label-Owner, Verleger, Manager, Veranstalter - oder einfach ein Fan, so wie ich?Da draußen im Musikbusiness passiert gerade ein großes Umdenken, ja eine richtige Revolution. Du hast jetzt die Wahl und kannst jetzt als einer der Ersten ein Teil davon sein - oder lieber abwartend noch etwas zuschauen. Nur: Vorbeikommen wirst Du daran wahrscheinlich nicht mehr. Dieser digitale D-Zug hat sich schon längst unaufhaltsam in Bewegung gesetzt….Doch bevor Du in eine FOMO – in eine Fear Of Missing Out, also, eine Angst etwas zu verpassen verfällst: In diesen Episoden gibt es ab sofort von mir regelmäßig die brandheißen First-Hand-News rund um Prozesse, die für Dich im ersten Augenblick wahrscheinlich genauso kryptisch klingen, wie für mich noch vor einem guten Jahr: NFTs und Token, die Blockchain-Technologie, das Web 3.0 und das Metaverse. WTF!?Aber ich verspreche Dir, ich nehme Dich hier an die Hand und werde Dir diese doch sehr technischen Vorgänge an vielen plakativen Beispielen erklären. Denn mein Ziel ist es, wenn Du diesen Podcast regelmäßig hörst, wirst Du schneller verstehenwie Musiker unabhängig ihres Genres ihre Rechte selbst auswerten, eine zusätzliche digitale Community als VIP-Fanclub aufbauen und sogar ihre treuesten Fans in ihre Musik investieren lassen.wie Rechteinhaber in Form von Labels oder Publisher zusätzliche Einnahmen abseits von physischen Tonträgerverkäufen oder Streamings generieren, ganz neue Marketing- und Promotion-Möglichkeiten erhalten oder gar einen Booster für die Charts einsetzen könnten.wie Live-Veranstalter ihren Tickets weitere Utilities mitgeben, exklusives digitales Festival-Merch als Incentive anbieten, Ticketpreise unter Kontrolle halten und sogar aus Plastikmüll Kunst erschaffen könnten.wo Musik-Liebhaber für ihre Sammel-Leidenschaft einzigartige Musik-Raritäten sowie musikbasierte Kunst finden, kaufen und handeln.wie sich Fans an zukünftigen Projekten ihrer Lieblingskünstler beteiligen, um so nicht einfach nur als Crowd zu supporten, sondern auch persönlich an potentiellen Erfolgen mitverdienen könnten.wie Grafiker, Designer, Fotografen, Videokünstler und 3D-Visual Artists ihre Werke mit der Musikwelt verbinden und durch eine Co-Kreation vollkommen neue gemeinsame Kunstformen erschaffen könnten undwie Marken und Unternehmen in diesem emotionalen Umfeld ihre Brands und Produkte platzieren, exklusive Markenerlebnisse erschaffen und von der Strahlkraft der Musik und Werten der Künstler profitieren könnten.Fühlst Du Dich hier irgendwie angesprochen? Dann schnall Dich fest und lass uns auf der Blockchain reiten!Ich bin Uwe Lerch, seit über 30 Jahren im magischen Dreieck zwischen Musik, Marken und Menschen unterwegs und habe hier Einiges zu erzählen. Damit Du nichts verpasst, lass doch hier ein Abo da, dann hören wir uns bald wieder.

Gerne melde ich mich für eine kurze unverbindliche Analyse und wir entscheiden dann, wie Dein Weg weitergehen könnte.Achtung:Dieser Podcast ist nichts für Krypto-Experten und selbsternannte NFT-Hodler. Es gibt auch keine Anlageberatung und keine Finanztipps!
