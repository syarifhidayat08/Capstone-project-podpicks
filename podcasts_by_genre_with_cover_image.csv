7aCtjfpNpxZkQm1SvATjNd,Stormy Daniels - Audio Biography,"Stephanie Gregory Clifford, known professionally as Stormy Daniels, is an American adult film actress, director, and writer who gained international fame due to her alleged affair with former U.S. President Donald Trump and the subsequent legal battles and media attention that followed. Early Life and Career Beginnings Stormy Daniels was born on March 17, 1979, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. She grew up in a middle-class family and attended Scotlandville Magnet High School. During her teenage years, Daniels developed an interest in acting and performing. In 1996, at the age of 17, Daniels began her career in the adult entertainment industry as a stripper. She worked at various clubs across the country, eventually transitioning into adult films in 2002. Her stage name, ""Stormy Daniels,"" was derived from the combination of the Mötley Crüe bassist Nikki Sixx's daughter's name, Storm, and the surname of Jack Daniels whiskey. Adult Film Career Throughout her career in the adult film industry, Stormy Daniels has appeared in over 150 films and has directed more than 70 movies. She has worked with numerous major adult film studios, such as Wicked Pictures and Digital Playground. In 2004, Daniels won the Best New Starlet Award from Adult Video News (AVN), one of the most prestigious accolades in the industry. In addition to her work as a performer, Daniels has also been recognized for her work as a director. She has directed films for Wicked Pictures and has received several award nominations for her directorial efforts. Daniels is known for her focus on female-driven storylines and her ability to create engaging content within the adult film genre. Mainstream Media Appearances Outside of her work in the adult film industry, Stormy Daniels has made several appearances in mainstream media. In 2005, she appeared in the comedy film ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" playing a small role as a porn star. She has also guest-starred on television shows such as ""Dirt"" and ""Marci X."" In 2007, Daniels considered running for the Senate in Louisiana against incumbent David Vitter. She announced the potential campaign as a Republican candidate, focusing on issues such as sex education, tax reform, and the need for more women in leadership positions. However, she ultimately decided not to run for office. Alleged Affair with Donald Trump In January 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported that Stormy Daniels had allegedly had an affair with then-businessman Donald Trump in 2006, shortly after his wife Melania had given birth to their son, Barron. The article also claimed that Trump's attorney, Michael Cohen, had paid Daniels $130,000 in hush money just before the 2016 presidential election to keep the affair quiet. Daniels initially denied the affair and the payment, but in February 2018, she publicly acknowledged the alleged relationship in an interview with Jimmy Kimmel. She claimed that she and Trump had engaged in a consensual affair and that she had signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) in exchange for the $130,000 payment. Legal Battles and Media Attention Following the public acknowledgment of the alleged affair, Stormy Daniels and her attorney, Michael Avenatti, engaged in a highly publicized legal battle with President Trump and his legal team. Daniels filed a lawsuit against Trump, claiming that the NDA she had signed was invalid because Trump had never signed it himself. The legal dispute garnered significant media attention, with Daniels and Avenatti making frequent appearances on news programs and talk shows. The case also led to the revelation that Michael Cohen had made the $130,000 payment to Daniels, which sparked further investigations into potential campaign finance violations. In March 2019, a federal judge dismissed Daniels' lawsuit against Trump, stating that the suit was irrelevant after Trump and Cohen had agreed not to enforce the NDA. However, the legal battle continued, with Daniels filing a defamation suit against Trump for his comments about her on Twitter. The defamation case was ultimately dismissed as well. Impact on Popular Culture The Stormy Daniels scandal had a significant impact on popular culture and public discourse. The story dominated news headlines for months and sparked discussions about power dynamics, gender roles, and the intersection of politics and the adult entertainment industry. Daniels became a household name and a symbol of resistance for many who opposed the Trump administration. She was featured in numerous interviews, appeared on magazine covers, and even embarked on a nationwide strip club tour called ""Make America Horny Again,"" a play on Trump's campaign slogan. The scandal also inspired various forms of artistic expression, including a satirical rap song by Yung Gravy titled ""Stoopy Daniels"" and a ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch featuring Alec Baldwin as Trump and Cecily Strong as Daniels. Recent Activities and Personal Life In 2018, Stormy Daniels released a memoir titled ""Full Disclosure,"" in which she detailed her alleged affair with Trump and her experiences in the adult film industry. The book became a New York Times bestseller and further solidified Daniels' place in the public eye. Daniels continues to work in the adult entertainment industry as a performer and director. She has also ventured into stand-up comedy, performing at clubs and venues across the United States. In her personal life, Daniels is a mother to a daughter born in 2011 and is an outspoken advocate for various political and social causes. In conclusion, Stormy Daniels' biography is one that encompasses a successful career in the adult film industry, mainstream media appearances, and a high-profile legal battle with a sitting U.S. President. Her story has sparked important conversations about power, gender, and the intersection of politics and entertainment, solidifying her place as a significant figure in contemporary American culture.

5jlY6akHFjas2bp5tc8ARk,2024 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,"Decoding the 2024 Rock Hall Ballot: Genre-Bending Visionaries & Enduring Legacies The 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame nominations sparked fiery debates. This year's intriguing slate features trailblazers long overdue with first-timers reflecting cultural diversity. It's a snapshot of evolving influence paradigms for modern eras. Analyzing individual merits within a broader context, 20th-century pop history takes center stage, with contemporary relevance challenging nostalgic icons. Let's dive deeper. Crossing Genre Lines: Five groundbreaking women make history, half the ballot. Mariah Carey and Cher redefine ""diva"" with crossover dominance, reinventing vocal traditions for pop eras. While not bluesy rock-like founding inductees, their impact is undeniable. Jane's Addiction, alternative royalty, pay homage to indie punk predecessors. Perry Farrell's pioneering Lollapalooza visioned modern festival culture, uniting contrasting styles with rebellious DNA. Two seminal hip-hop duos seek third-time's-the-charm. Eric B & Rakim laid the foundation for complex lyricism, now commonplace. A Tribe Called Quest pioneered jazz fusions, pushing beyond MC parties towards high art transcending clubs. Both deserve eventual bronze busts in Cleveland. Global Phenoms Export Identity: Manchester's Oasis court Anglophile voters, following The Smiths, Beatles, etc. Liam and Noel Gallagher brought working-class swagger, selling millions with Beatles-inspired stadium anthems. Their impact reaches the ""old Empire."" Jamaican-British chanteuse Sade defies trends. Her sophisti-pop soul emanates timeless cool. ""Promise"" birthed 80s makeout classics, influencing countless fans. Her enduring career and devoted fanbase make her unique. Diaspora Caribbean roots uplift with Kool & The Gang. Overcoming the 70s disco stigma, they created a universal ""stayin' alive"" legacy, packing dancefloors for decades. Let the ladies sway to their signature ""Shindig"" swagger. Alchemizing Blues into Gold: Peter Frampton won hearts with The Herd, then honed his tone with Humble Pie before capturing the zeitgeist with his 1976 mega-hit, the top Billboard seller before Thriller. Yet, his legacy hinges almost solely on the 11-minute ""Do You Feel Like We Do."" An inspiring reminder of underdogs' triumphs. Ozzy Osbourne follows in Black Sabbath's footsteps, gaining nominations but missing induction. He pioneered punk-infused metal theatrics, inspiring headbangers. He deserves this recognition. Lenny Kravitz bridges generations, channeling 60s protest poetry for 90s alternative legions. His relentless work ethic keeps him current. This nomination honors his longevity, mentoring younger artists like Khaled and Post Malone. Arena Dominating Showstoppers: Anglo-American pomp DJs Foreigner expertly aimed anthemic stadium pleasers, conquering late 70s airwaves. Powered by classically trained guitarist Mick Jones, their orchestral overtures inspired future masters from Extreme to Taylor Swift. Foreigner's enduring radio presence and relentless touring warrant a Hall pass. Similar respect goes to Kool & The Gang, returning with a nod to their funky roots. They deliver non-stop party anthems, making Earth inhabitants cheer and dance anywhere. Girls! Respect Overdue: Mary J. Blige's profound influence embedded confessional hip-hop into R&B vulnerability, pioneering a movement where divas wear flaws as badges of honor. She moves souls, baring her scars. Sinéad O'Connor followed her truth, confronting injustice and hypocrisy. Her voice deserves recognition for going beyond ""Nothing Compares 2 U."" Deserving Institutionals: Rounding out the ballot are repeat nominees. Dave Matthews Band continues to draw crowds and passionate followings. Jane's Addiction's second-wave nod seems fitting, given their Lollapalooza legacy. Blue Öyster Cult returns for their cowbell-clanging classics. Changing Criteria: This ballot reflects shifting priorities. Some hard rock fans might feel ignored, but the Hall must acknowledge evolving pop culture markers. Does hip-hop deserve a strong presence? Do streaming and touring receipts now define impact? If rock signifies attitude beyond blues roots, shouldn't the Hall recognize new styles and vulnerability driving cultural shifts? Healthy debates will continue. But this diverse class suggests an awareness of broadening horizons. The committee seems to acknowledge a wider spectrum of innovators, pioneering new genres, attitudes, and messages that reflect changing times beyond traditional rock radio structures. This will ultimately strengthen the Rock Hall's relevance and document the ongoing musical revolution. The 2024 ballot is a first draft of history, deserving appreciation for its individual and collective representation of key artistic pillars that have upheld pop music's vast architecture over the past half-century. These nominees carried culture forward through their original craft and inspiration, rippling outwards for generations to come. And Hey! History buffs, buckle up!

0TRsT4WlA0379fmlhudhIB,Beyoncé  and The Magic of Texas Hold 'Em,"Beyoncé's new song ""Texas Hold 'Em"" marks a significant foray into the country music genre for the globally renowned artist, known primarily for her roots in R&B, pop, and hip-hop. Released during the 2024 Super Bowl, the song, along with ""16 Carriages,"" showcases Beyoncé's versatile musical talent and her ability to bridge diverse musical styles while celebrating her cultural heritage. Details and Themes: ""Texas Hold 'Em"" stands out with its lively beat and country-inspired rhythms, blending traditional country elements with Beyoncé's unmistakable vocal style. The lyrics invoke imagery of classic country life, including references to Texas, playing cards, and communal dance, all while maintaining Beyoncé's characteristic empowerment and boldness. The song's narrative encourages listeners to embrace the moment, let down their guards, and join in a collective celebration, reminiscent of a country hoedown but with a modern twist. In contrast, ""16 Carriages"" presents a more melodic and introspective ballad. It explores themes of loss, longing, and reflection, set against a backdrop of a fading sunset and a journey away from dreams. This track complements ""Texas Hold 'Em"" by showcasing the emotional depth and storytelling characteristic of country music, while still infusing it with Beyoncé's unique sound and perspective. Cultural Impact and Discussion: The release of ""Texas Hold 'Em"" has reignited conversations about the representation of black artists in country music, a genre historically perceived as predominantly white. Beyoncé's entry into this space is not just a musical crossover but a cultural statement, challenging traditional boundaries and highlighting the African American influences within country music's roots. Critics and fans alike have noted the song's ability to bring attention to black musicians within country music, contributing to a broader appreciation and recognition of their work. Artists like Adia Victoria, Mickey Guyton, and Rissi Palmer, among others, have seen increased listenership and engagement following the song's release, signaling a shift towards more inclusivity in the genre. Moreover, Beyoncé's ""Texas Hold 'Em"" has sparked discussions on social media and among music industry professionals about what constitutes ""authentic"" country music and who gets to define it. The song's reception by country radio stations has been mixed, with some embracing the new track and others hesitant to include it in their playlists, reflecting ongoing debates about genre boundaries and artistic identity. Personal and Artistic Significance: Beyoncé's exploration of country music with ""Texas Hold 'Em"" and ""16 Carriages"" is also a nod to her Texan roots and personal history. Growing up in Houston, Texas, Beyoncé was exposed to a blend of musical influences, including country, Tejano, and soul, which have all shaped her eclectic musical style. By incorporating elements of country music into her repertoire, Beyoncé is not only paying homage to her heritage but also redefining her artistic expression. The release of these songs and the announcement of her new album ""Renaissance: Act II"" signify Beyoncé's ongoing evolution as an artist and her commitment to pushing musical boundaries. Her venture into country music exemplifies how she continues to explore new territories, both thematically and sonically, while remaining grounded in her identity and influences. In summary, Beyoncé's ""Texas Hold 'Em"" is more than just a song; it's a cultural moment that bridges genres, challenges stereotypes, and celebrates the rich tapestry of American music. As she continues to explore the intersections of race, culture, and musical genres, Beyoncé not only enriches her own artistic legacy but also paves the way for future generations of musicians to defy categorization and express their diverse identities.

7EdVfOC6fuQozAXo3jCf3i,Hunter S. Thompson - Audio Biography,"Hunter S. Thompson: The Life and Legacy of Gonzo Journalism's Infamous Provocateur Introduction: Hunter Stockton Thompson (July 18, 1937 – February 20, 2005) was an American journalist and author who pioneered the genre of Gonzo journalism, a highly personal and often controversial style of reporting that blurred the lines between writer and subject, fact and fiction. Throughout his tumultuous career, Thompson's provocative writing, unconventional lifestyle, and scathing critiques of American politics and culture made him a counterculture icon and one of the most influential voices of his generation. Early Life and Education: Born in Louisville, Kentucky, to Jack Robert Thompson, an insurance agent, and Virginia Ray Davison, a librarian, Hunter S. Thompson grew up in a middle-class family. His early life was marked by rebelliousness and a disdain for authority, traits that would later define his writing and public persona. Thompson attended Louisville Male High School, where he was a member of the literary club and the Athenaeum Literary Association. Despite his intelligence and writing talent, Thompson's disruptive behavior led to his expulsion from high school in 1955. Following his expulsion, Thompson enlisted in the United States Air Force, where he served as a sports editor for the base newspaper at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. During his time in the Air Force, Thompson honed his writing skills and developed a keen interest in journalism. After being honorably discharged in 1958, he began his career as a professional writer, working as a freelance journalist for various publications, including the New York Herald Tribune, The National Observer, and Rolling Stone magazine. Rise to Fame and Gonzo Journalism: In the 1960s, Thompson gained notoriety for his unconventional and often controversial writing style, which came to be known as Gonzo journalism. This approach, characterized by its highly subjective and often exaggerated first-person narrative, rejected the traditional tenets of objective reporting in favor of a more immersive and experiential form of storytelling. Thompson's writing was marked by his biting wit, scathing social commentary, and a willingness to blur the lines between fact and fiction in pursuit of a deeper truth. Thompson's breakthrough work, ""Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs"" (1967), was a prime example of his Gonzo style. The book, which chronicled Thompson's experiences living and riding with the notorious motorcycle gang, offered a gritty and unfiltered look at the counterculture movement of the 1960s. The success of ""Hell's Angels"" established Thompson as a major voice in American journalism and cemented his reputation as a fearless and uncompromising observer of American society. Political Writings and ""Fear and Loathing"": Throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, Thompson became increasingly involved in political reporting, covering major events such as the 1968 Democratic National Convention and the 1972 presidential campaign. His most famous work from this period, ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream"" (1971), was a wild and hallucinatory tale of drug-fueled excess and social commentary that captured the zeitgeist of the era. In ""Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72,"" Thompson provided a scathing and often hilarious account of the 1972 presidential race between Richard Nixon and George McGovern. The book, which originally appeared as a series of articles in Rolling Stone, showcased Thompson's unique blend of political analysis, personal anecdotes, and biting satire, cementing his status as one of the most important and influential political writers of his generation. Later Years and Legacy: In the later years of his career, Thompson continued to write for various publications, including ESPN and Vanity Fair, and authored several more books, such as ""The Great Shark Hunt"" (1979), ""Generation of Swine"" (1988), and ""Kingdom of Fear"" (2003). Despite his declining health and struggles with substance abuse, Thompson remained an outspoken critic of American politics and culture, often using his platform to denounce corruption, injustice, and the erosion of civil liberties. On February 20, 2005, at the age of 67, Hunter S. Thompson died by suicide at his fortified compound in Woody Creek, Colorado. In accordance with his wishes, his ashes were fired from a cannon in a ceremony attended by friends, family, and celebrities, including Johnny Depp, Bill Murray, and Sean Penn. Thompson's legacy as a writer and cultural figure continues to inspire and influence generations of journalists, authors, and artists. His Gonzo style of journalism, characterized by its blend of fact and fiction, subjectivity and satire, has left an indelible mark on the world of reporting and storytelling. Moreover, his uncompromising spirit, iconoclastic wit, and commitment to speaking truth to power have made him an enduring symbol of counterculture rebellion and anti-establishment dissent. The impact of Hunter S. Thompson's work extends far beyond the realm of journalism. His writing has been adapted into films, such as ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" (1998) and ""The Rum Diary"" (2011), and has influenced countless writers, filmmakers, and artists across various media. Thompson's persona, marked by his trademark aviator sunglasses, cigarette holder, and wild, drug-fueled antics, has become a cultural icon, emblematic of a particular strain of American individualism and anti-authoritarianism. Despite the controversy that often surrounded his life and work, Hunter S. Thompson's contributions to American literature and journalism are undeniable. His unique voice, unflinching honesty, and ability to capture the essence of a particular moment in history have earned him a place among the most important and influential writers of the 20th century. In many ways, Thompson's life and work serve as a testament to the power of the written word to challenge social norms, expose injustice, and provoke change. His legacy reminds us of the importance of speaking truth to power, even in the face of opposition or personal risk, and the vital role that journalists and writers play in shaping our understanding of the world around us. As we continue to grapple with the complex social, political, and cultural issues of our time, the example set by Hunter S. Thompson remains as relevant and inspiring as ever. His commitment to truth-telling, his rejection of conformity, and his unwavering belief in the transformative power of language continue to serve as a beacon for those who seek to challenge the status quo and fight for a more just and equitable world. In the end, Hunter S. Thompson's life and work stand as a testament to the enduring power of the human spirit to resist oppression, speak truth to power, and bear witness to the beauty, chaos, and absurdity of the human experience. His legacy will continue to inspire and inform generations of writers, artists, and activists, reminding us of the importance of living life on our own terms and never surrendering our freedom, our integrity, or our voice.

6QCPx0srIfXq2z20KYFuqG,Stephen King - Audio Biography,"Stephen Edwin King, born on September 21, 1947, in Portland, Maine, is one of the most renowned and prolific authors of our time. His works have transcended the boundaries of genre, captivating readers with their blend of horror, suspense, fantasy, and psychological depth. King's journey to becoming a literary icon is a testament to his unwavering passion for storytelling and his ability to tap into the deepest fears and desires of the human psyche. King's early life was marked by hardship and adversity. His father, Donald Edwin King, a merchant seaman, abandoned the family when Stephen was just two years old, leaving his mother, Nellie Ruth King, to raise Stephen and his older brother, David, on her own. The family struggled financially, moving frequently between Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Stratford, Connecticut, as Nellie sought work to support her children. Despite the challenges he faced, King found solace in reading and writing from a young age. He was particularly drawn to the works of H.P. Lovecraft, Robert Bloch, and Ray Bradbury, as well as EC horror comics like Tales from the Crypt. These early influences would later shape King's own writing style, which often blends elements of horror, fantasy, and science fiction to create stories that are both terrifying and deeply empathetic. King's love of writing began to manifest itself in tangible ways during his school years. He attended Durham Elementary School and Lisbon Falls High School, where he excelled academically and began writing short stories. Many of these early works were published in fanzines and local newspapers, showcasing King's burgeoning talent as a storyteller. In 1966, King enrolled at the University of Maine at Orono, where he studied English and participated in student politics. It was during this time that he met his future wife, Tabitha Spruce, who was also an aspiring writer. The couple married in 1971 and would go on to have three children: Naomi, Joe, and Owen. After graduating from college in 1970, King struggled to find a teaching job. He took on various odd jobs to support his family, including working as a janitor, a gas pump attendant, and a laundry worker. Despite the financial hardships, King never lost sight of his dream of becoming a writer. He continued to write short stories and novels in his spare time, honing his craft and developing his unique voice. King's persistence and dedication paid off in 1973 when he sold his first novel, Carrie, to Doubleday. The story of a teenage girl with telekinetic powers who takes revenge on her bullies became an instant success, selling over a million copies in its first year and establishing King as a major force in the horror genre. The success of Carrie marked the beginning of an extraordinarily prolific and influential career. Over the next few decades, King would go on to write some of the most beloved and terrifying books of all time, including The Shining (1977), The Stand (1978), It (1986), Misery (1987), and The Green Mile (1996). His works have been adapted into numerous films, television series, and comic books, cementing his status as a pop culture icon. One of King's most iconic novels, The Shining, tells the story of Jack Torrance, a struggling writer who takes a job as a caretaker at the remote Overlook Hotel. As Jack descends into madness, his young son, Danny, must use his own psychic powers to survive the evil forces that inhabit the hotel. The novel was later adapted into a classic film by Stanley Kubrick, starring Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall. The Shining showcases many of the themes and motifs that would become hallmarks of King's writing: the exploration of the dark side of human nature, the power of the supernatural, and the resilience of the human spirit in the face of unimaginable horror. The novel also demonstrates King's ability to create fully realized, complex characters who are both relatable and deeply flawed. Another of King's most famous works, It, follows a group of childhood friends who reunite as adults to confront an evil entity that has been terrorizing their hometown of Derry, Maine. The novel's central villain, Pennywise the Clown, has become one of the most recognizable and feared characters in horror fiction, embodying the primal fear of the unknown and the malevolent. It is a prime example of King's ability to blend the mundane with the monstrous, creating a sense of unease and dread that permeates every page. The novel also explores themes of childhood trauma, the power of friendship, and the cyclical nature of evil, demonstrating King's deep understanding of the human condition. Throughout his career, King has experimented with various genres and formats, from the epistolary novel Carrie to the serialized novel The Green Mile. He has also written non-fiction works, including the memoir On Writing (2000) and the essay collection Danse Macabre (1981), in which he reflects on the nature of horror and its place in our culture. King's memoir, On Writing, offers a fascinating glimpse into his creative process and the experiences that have shaped him as a writer. Part autobiography, part writing guide, the book is a must-read for aspiring writers and King fans alike. In it, King shares his insights on the craft of writing, the importance of discipline and perseverance, and the role of imagination in storytelling. In addition to his literary achievements, King has been an advocate for various social and political causes. He has spoken out against censorship, supported anti-war efforts, and championed the rights of writers and artists. In 2003, he was awarded the National Book Foundation's Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, recognizing his lifetime of work and his impact on American culture. Despite his success, King has faced his share of personal struggles. In 1999, he was struck by a van while walking near his home in Lovell, Maine, suffering severe injuries that required extensive surgery and rehabilitation. The accident also forced him to confront his own mortality and the fragility of life, themes that would later emerge in his writing. King's accident and subsequent recovery had a profound impact on his work. In the years that followed, he wrote several novels that grappled with themes of mortality, redemption, and the human capacity for resilience in the face of overwhelming odds. These works, including Dreamcatcher (2001), Duma Key (2008), and 11/22/63 (2011), showcase King's ability to use personal experience as a lens through which to explore universal truths about the human condition. King's impact on popular culture cannot be overstated. His books have sold over 350 million copies worldwide, making him one of the best-selling authors of all time. He has inspired countless writers, filmmakers, and artists, and his influence can be seen in everything from hit television shows like Stranger Things to the resurgence of the horror genre in recent years. In his personal life, King has been married to Tabitha for over 50 years, and they continue to live in Maine. Their sons, Joe and Owen, have followed in their father's footsteps, becoming successful writers in their own right. King's daughter, Naomi, is a Unitarian Universalist minister and an advocate for LGBTQ+ rights. Throughout his career, King has been praised for his ability to tap into the deepest fears and anxieties of the human psyche, creating stories that are both terrifying and deeply empathetic. He has a unique talent for creating fully realized characters and immersive worlds, drawing readers in and keeping them captivated until the very last page. One of the most remarkable things about King's writing is its accessibility. Despite the often dark and disturbing nature of his stories, King has a way of making his work relatable and engaging to a wide audience. He writes about ordinary people in extraordinary situations, exploring the ways in which trauma, grief, and fear can shape our lives and our relationships. King's influence extends far beyond the world of literature. His stories have inspired countless adaptations in film, television, and theater, from classic horror movies like The Shining and Carrie to more recent productions like the It franchise and the Castle Rock series. His work has also been the subject of numerous academic studies, exploring themes of gender, race, class, and power in American society. In recent years, King has continued to be a prolific and influential presence in the literary world. He has published several new novels, including The Institute (2019) and Later (2021), as well as a collection of short stories titled If It Bleeds (2020). These works demonstrate King's ongoing commitment to pushing the boundaries of genre and exploring new narrative possibilities. The Institute, for example, is a gripping tale of government conspiracy and the abuse of power, centered around a group of children with supernatural abilities who are held captive in a secret facility. The novel showcases King's ability to blend elements of science fiction, horror, and social commentary into a compelling and thought-provoking narrative. Later, on the other hand, is a crime thriller with a supernatural twist, following a young boy with the ability to see and communicate with the dead. The novel is a testament to King's versatility as a writer and his ability to subvert genre expectations in surprising and engaging ways. In addition to his literary output, King has also been an outspoken critic of former President Donald Trump, using his platform to advocate for progressive political causes and to challenge the rise of authoritarianism in American politics. King's political activism is a reminder of the power of storytelling to shape our understanding of the world and to inspire social change.

0ARyy1oEpOvHgYBvT2xVTb,Cannes 2024,"Cannes 2024: The 15 Movies We’re Most Excited to See As the Cannes Film Festival rolls into its 2024 iteration, the excitement buzzes through the air with the promise of groundbreaking cinema on display. This year, the festival’s lineup is a vibrant tapestry of storytelling that includes anticipated projects from film legends, daring explorations by up-and-coming directors, and performances set to captivate audiences worldwide. Here’s a look at the top 15 movies that stand out in this year's diverse and dynamic selection. 1. Revolutionary Voices in Cinema First up, the festival is set to unveil a musical that intertwines the complex narratives of drug cartels and gender identity with the star power of Selena Gomez. This film not only challenges the boundaries of traditional musical cinema but also delves into pressing social issues, making it a groundbreaking project to watch. 2. Tales of Love and Desperation Another compelling entry is a film that tells the story of a Brooklyn sex worker whose life takes a fairy-tale turn when she falls in love with the son of a Russian oligarch. This narrative combines elements of romance and tragedy, exploring deep emotional and societal themes. 3. A Cinematic Homage From Italy, a director pays tribute to his roots with a baroque filmmaking style that has become increasingly rare. This film, named after a siren from The Odyssey, is anticipated to be both a visual and narrative feast, deeply embedded in rich cultural and cinematic traditions. 4. A Filmmaker's Reflection Adding to the introspective theme, a French director presents a film that is a tribute to his own illustrious career, featuring characters that represent the heroes and villains from his past works. This self-reflective piece promises to offer insights into the creative process of one of France’s cinematic veterans. 5. The Return of Legends The festival will also mark the return of a New Hollywood legend with a project shrouded in mystery but expected to be one of the highlights of the festival. Similarly, an Australian New Wave legend is set to premiere a high-octane sequel that has been eagerly awaited by fans and critics alike. 6. Documentary Excellence A poignant entry in the documentary category focuses on Ukraine, offering a harrowing yet uplifting look at resilience in the face of ongoing conflict. This film is expected to not only bring attention to the human spirit but also highlight the geopolitical issues at play. 7. Biographical Narratives The biopic genre is well-represented with a film exploring Donald Trump’s younger, pre-fascist years, providing a controversial yet intriguing look at the formative years of a figure who would later dominate global politics. 8. Festival Starters and High-profile Premieres The festival kicks off with a film by Quentin Dupieux, featuring Louis Garrel and Léa Seydoux, which is a comedy expected to set a lighthearted tone for the event. Following this are premieres from icons such as Francis Ford Coppola and David Cronenberg, whose new works are among the most anticipated at the festival. 9. Global Cinema Representation Directors from across the globe, including Yorgos Lanthimos, Paul Schrader, Andrea Arnold, and Jia Zhang-ke, will showcase their latest projects, each bringing their unique perspectives to the fore. These films range from intimate personal stories to large-scale cinematic endeavors. 10. Exploring New Themes The festival lineup explores a variety of themes through different genres. From a musical about a cartel lord’s transformation spurred by gender identity issues to a dark comedy about three women whose meddling in their neighbors' lives goes disastrously wrong, each film offers a unique story. 11. Innovative Storytelling Innovative storytelling is a hallmark of this year’s festival. For example, a movie featuring a Brooklyn-based sex worker turns into a real-life Cinderella story, and another film combines a historical biopic with satirical elements to explore the early life of Donald Trump. 12. Character-Driven Dramas Character-driven dramas are also prominent, with films that delve deep into individual psychologies and relationships. These movies, set against broad social backdrops, aim to provide insight into personal and societal dynamics. 13. Historical and Political Narratives Some films at the festival will tackle historical and political issues, providing commentary through narrative cinema. These entries are set to engage audiences with their thoughtful exploration of significant historical events and figures. 14. Closing Highlights As the festival draws to a close, some of the most talked-about films are set to premiere, ensuring that the festival ends on a high note. These final films are expected to be strong contenders for the various awards and could potentially set the tone for cinema in the coming year. 15. A Look Ahead Looking beyond the festival, these films are expected to impact the broader cinematic landscape, influencing discussions and developments in film for years to come. As Cannes continues to be a pivotal platform for showcasing global cinema, the films premiered here will likely resonate well beyond their initial screenings. In conclusion, Cannes 2024 is set to be a landmark event, rich with diverse narratives and bold, inventive filmmaking. With a lineup that balances seasoned directors with fresh new voices, this festival is poised to celebrate the past, present, and future of cinema in all its glory. As we delve into this cinematic feast, each film promises not just entertainment but a profound exploration of the human condition and the world we live in.

0xngWcEvzfDGk2pGSR2GwF,Playboy Carti - Audio Biography,"Playboi Carti: Hip Hop's Punk Prince Pioneering the Sound of Underground Trap Rage and Redemption Bursting onto hip hop’s chaotic avant-garde landscape early last decade cloaked ominously yet playfully in Satanic imagery and shrouded behind enigmatic public presence, Atlanta phenom Playboi Carti manifested seemingly overnight as newly christened prince expanding trap music’s outermost experimental fringes. Backed by raw magnetism fusing unhinged punk fury with serpentine adlib invention over haunting minimalist production, the unconventional MC born Jordan Terrell Carter quickly galvanized youthfully nihilistic followers into rapt cult fervor through iconic mixtape Playboi Carti and crossover magnum opus Die Lit while continuously disrupting conventions bending genre limits at every turn henceforth. Much as predecessor trailblazers Lil Wayne and Young Thug before him dissolved rigid hip-hop formulas by embracing resonant nonsense brimming with pure preternatural artistry, Playboi Carti similarly conquered through sheer prolificacy and slippery vocal virtuosity rather than dense lyrical substance. Yet beyond the hypnotic baby-voiced delivery scattering non-sequitur one-liners like hailstorm machine gun scattershot over creepily melodic trap instrumentals lays profound substance evangelizing for a disaffected generation discovering agency through embracing identity multitudes rather than self-censoring strange brilliance to conform with societal molds. Because for myriad alienated acolytes gravitationally pulled into Playboi Carti’s orbit coalescing around 2018’s Die Lit before culminating with Whole Lotta Red’s era-crowning punk apotheosis, this belovedPrince presents living permission tearing down limiting walls that often stunt free soulful becoming by mere strange difference. Like some candy-coated cipher translating trauma into liberating personal mythology reframing pain as magical armor, Carti renders being gloriously misunderstood as a blessing, not a curse for outcasts battered but still breathing. His divine flock need only pledge allegiance celebrating glorious freak flags held high and obsessions cultivated to theater at Carti’s carnivalesque feet. The prodigy found an early baptism by fire that fuels Carti’s music reflecting past and present demons alike still requiring exorcism. Born in 1996 becoming immersed by middle school in Atlanta’s emergent hip hop underground birthing luminaries like Lil Yachty and Young Thug alongside producers Icytwat and Mexikodro, Carter wandered seeking purpose torn between music and basketball pathways before high school ended. Hardscrabble stability was lacking for Carti bouncing homes and even schools far too often to focus ambitions beyond survival, already gravitating by 16 toward mischief and temptation from peers already embracing trap life hustles luring fast fame and money seemingly beyond reach honestly. Yet destiny called Carter toward nobler arts after early collaborations birthed immediate viral hits locally - an organic grassroots groundswell propelling the prodigy far from limited horizons once temporarily resigned from accepting. New York connections soon fostered through happenstance chemistry with A$AP Mob artists captivated by this enigmatic wunderkind already displaying game-changing flair. After personal turbulence entering adulthood chased ambitions briefly off-track, Carti ultimately committed to fully manifesting his long-percolating musical gifts just as cultural acceleration craved his wizardry. Those earliest formative chapters navigating chaotic identity navigation and industry labyrinths while laying musical foundations clearly cast the longest shadows still reflected throughout Carti’s sprawling mythology. Early music centered parties and earthly pleasures as escapism coping, yet violent demons and paranoia of dishonest forces seeking his unmaking emerged in later anthems highlighting the immense weight shouldered forging independent power against destructive shadows constantly encroaching. Yet from fire and fury birthed beauty still - chrysalis dark nights transformed nexus for connections creating Chosen Family lifelines together facing storms in solidarity henceforth. Once immersed in relocating to Los Angeles circa 2018 upon Die Lit's launch cemented elite icon status, Playboi Carti attracted creative collaborators like executive producer Pi’erre Bourne plus rap luminaries Travis Scott and Solange crafting integral extensions Carti’s trademark soundscapes fused with erudite exploration embracing questions of purpose at fame’s hollow peak. During marathon recording sessions birthed legendary leaked singles like fan favorite “Kid Cudi” dropped ceremoniously Christmas 2020 heralding the Second Coming fulfilled through epic magnum opus Whole Lotta Red. With a messianic return, Playboi Carti fully emerged reborn as an abstract hip hop soothsayer consecrating punk's holy wedding. Two years removed since last releasing new material, Red’s Day arrival sparked bedlam delivering the long-awaited narrative arc epiphany. Through the project Carti undergoes a symbolic death and spiritual rebirth painfully shedding externally defined masks to wholly reconnect with the sacred creative nucleus at his core - that wide-eyed kid wandering Atlanta’s Metropolitan Parkway immersed in destiny’s flow state. Transcending worldly constraints as true destiny’s child once more, Carti summons profound full-circle redemption powerfully healing and elevating generations of lost lambs through relatable catharsis. Yet four years henceforth since coronating hip hop’s new royal mythology expanding notions of black avant-garde expression, Playboi Carti remains characteristically elusive about precise artistic direction beyond sporadic cameo universe expansion appearances. Momentum still exponentially multiplies though from internet rumblings and musical breadcrumbs suggesting significant next chapters arriving imminently. As the latest headlines around legal turmoil and headlines sadly attest, the crown yet weighs heavy on this conflicted prince still navigating destiny’s precarious tightrope balancing soaring creative euphoria chasing earthbound stability further outreach daily. One prays Carti’s better angels prevail mastering righteous balance helping similarly vulnerable angels find righteous wings. Through poetry profound and pain alike alchemized into liberating art, Playboi Carti’s is divinely misunderstood. Thanks for listening to Quiet Please.

0AAuTHH7JsF9YXqpWTo577,Tyler The Creator and Louis Vuitton,"Tyler, The Creator Brings Irreverent Style to Louis Vuitton Collaboration Leave it to Pharrell Williams to keep the hits coming during his prolific tenure at Louis Vuitton. His latest bold move? Tapping red-hot collaborator Tyler, The Creator to design a playful capsule collection for the storied French fashion house. Slated to launch globally on March 21st, the ""Louis Vuitton Spring 2024 Men's Capsule by Tyler, The Creator"" brings the rapper's irreverently preppy style into the luxury fold. Known for bending genres in music, Tyler now gets to remix Louis Vuitton's codes through his own idiosyncratic lens. Pharrell wisely recognized Tyler's talents could infuse fresh spirit into the brand, blowing the doors open for new possibilities. ""Tyler has been my close friend and collaborator for years and we've always connected on music and design,"" Pharrell shared via email. ""This collaboration is unique to Louis Vuitton because it's a natural extension of our LVERS philosophy, building on our network of incredible artists and creatives."" Indeed, Pharrell's creative community mindset has reinvigorated Louis Vuitton with a cool, optimistic energy. Enlisting cultural icons like Tyler to share their visions pays it forward for future generations. By giving Tyler center stage, Pharrell empowers him to make LV his own. Never one to shy away from the spotlight, Tyler leaned into the chances to customize Louis Vuitton's signature elements. Most strikingly, he hand-drew an original interpretation of the brand's iconic monogram pattern, playfully dubbed the ""Craggy Monogram."" Rendered in shades of pastel pink, creamy vanilla, and chocolate, Tyler's Monogram incorporates his beloved airedale terriers alongside colorful doodles. Nods to his previous work with Murakami abound. This new Monogram appears across puffer jackets, backpacks, sneakers and other accessories. The rest of Tyler's capsule centers around clothes reflecting his own consistently eclectic style. Standouts include preppy cricket sweaters and cable knits in soothing hues, luxe mechanic jackets for motorbike rides, and tailored Bermuda shorts perfect for unconventional red carpet looks. Of course, Tyler also indulged his quirky obsessions through LV collaborator accessories. Think custom monogram cereal bowls with spoons, deluxe leather golf bags, canine-shaped crossbody pouches and even a travel chess set with hand-carved pieces. ""My main focus was making things I would wear all the time,"" Tyler explained. ""I dress the same in a meeting as I do a performance or grocery store trip, so hand drawing the monogram felt like the perfect balance to me."" Indeed, fans can expect to spot Tyler repping items from his namesake Louis Vuitton collection everywhere if his enthusiasm is any indicator. The hand-designed chess set ranks among his proudest creative achievements to date. ""The chessboard is one of the greatest things I've made and is definitely my favorite thing from the collection,"" he raved. ""The team was great to work with...P has always left a door open for me, but I still can't believe this one."" Pharrell no doubt grinned knowingly at Tyler's palpable excitement. When kindred creative spirits unite at Louis Vuitton, magic manifests. The capsule promises Tyler's inimitable influences through a luxury lens. Past collaborations between Pharrell and Tyler in music foreshadowed their natural rapport. Pharrell's productions and vocals have graced Tyler's albums for years. In turn, Tyler recently contributed a scene-stealing verse to Pharrell's 2022 single ""Cash In Cash Out."" But this new fashion partnership at Louis Vuitton represents their most multifaceted and rewarding joint endeavor so far. By merging their distinctive aesthetics and sensibilities, the pioneers remind us that playfulness and prestige can coexist beautifully. Expect Tyler's Craggy Monogram to become an instant collectible as his generation embraces LV in their own cultural terms. Yet the capsule also speaks to Pharrell's universal ethos - creativity as a community, openness as an opportunity, expression as freedom. Inclusive ideals never go out of fashion. So cue the cameras on March 21st as Tyler steps out head-to-toe in his custom Louis Vuitton. If his previous fashion moments are any indicator, he'll orchestrate an unforgettable scene guaranteed to go viral. But those lucky enough to score the limited-edition pieces can also rep the capsule in their own way. However fans style it, Tyler and Pharrell's energetic LV mashup promises to shake up traditional luxury spaces - and have a whole lot of fun in the process. When these genre-bending phenoms link up, expect only the freshest fits and beats. Thanks for listening to Quiet Please. Remember to like and share wherever you get your podcasts. And Hey!

3RV4spMYambJ1iuNRAzC2l,Tommy Smothers - Audio Biography,"Tommy Smothers: Rebellious Half of Legendary Comedy Duo As one-half of counterculture icons the Smothers Brothers comedy team, Tommy Smothers brought subversive left-wing politics to mainstream audiences through disarmingly innocent humor on hit 1960s variety show The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. His clueless onstage persona sharply contrasted social consciousness off-camera as a showrunner fighting CBS censors to advance civil rights messaging and anti-establishment sentiment during the Age of Aquarius. Though short-lived, the Brothers’ taboo-busting irreverence profoundly influenced topical satire for successors like Saturday Night Live launching riotous political commentary into living rooms nationwide. Early Years Born Thomas Bolyn Smothers III in 1939 to a career army officer, he and his younger brother Dickie bounced around military bases before eventually settling in California where teacher mother introduced them to folk music sparking lifelong performance passion. Tommy mastered dexterous yo-yo tricks and throwing skills as pastimes on remote bases. After studying theater at San Jose State College, Tommy toured as solo musical comedian caricaturing familiar folk genres. Closing shows his mischievous brother Dick would emerge to playfully upstage Tommy’s earnest singing with off-key joking parody. The audience was delighted in witnessing their spontaneous onstage clashing birthed lightbulb idea trying combined shtick as a duo. Billing themselves the Smothers Brothers, their act synthesized seemingly wholesome all-American brotherly harmony with subtly subversive themes. Underdog younger Dick continually outwitted supposedly smarter Tommy via interrupting questions needling holes in big brother’s clueless authority. This cheekily irreverent dynamic played ingeniously off 1960s protests questioning institutional power and credibility. Rising Fame Signed to major comedy tours and television variety showcases like Jack Paar, adrenaline rush performing won over initially reluctant Tommy who abandoned solo singing ambitions. Their perfectly calibrated comedic personality differences proved irresistible, catapulting the Smothers Brothers to national fame practically overnight. Following standout sets on shows starring Judy Garland and Steve Allen plus quickfire comedy cameos in Hollywood films like Beach Ball and C'mon, Let's Live a Little, the Brothers landed their own sitcom on CBS. Though short-lived, The Smothers Brothers Show earned an Emmy award and cemented popularity locking cross-generational appeal. In 1967 the duo returned to CBS starring The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour - an irreverent variety show slotted daringly at 9 PM Sundays when families and kids gathered around sets. While other hosts mostly played nice avoiding controversy, the brothers brought edgy counterculture humor addressing Vietnam, drugs, racism and religion amidst music acts like Jefferson Airplane or the Who. Catapulting youth antiwar sentiment into American households, their cheeky liberal potshots racked network alarm through sly Civil Rights shoutouts and anti-establishment swipes. The brothers’ radical reach horrified traditional viewers expecting safe superficial farce from primetime - sparking divisively soaring ratings while reactionary furor built. Rebellious Provocateurs While onscreen Tommy played the obtuse milquetoast opposite Dick’s pesky upstart, off-camera his steely leadership battled executives as the show's key writer and creative director shielding the cast from backlash amidst risky satire attuned to their college fanbase hungry for skewering hypocrisy. Sketches tackling taboo social issues brought national debates to the fore even though tension backstage boiled. Each broadcast ignited standoffs with network Standards and Practices department heads wary of alienating sponsors and Southern affiliates. The Brothers fought for every provocative joke and lyric earning exasperated rebukes or threats from the old guard. Tommy marshaled support shielding skittish staff from blowback so political potshots continued for a time letting America know where the counterculture generation stood. ‘ Alas, tensions climaxed when censors cut a comedic musical takedown of cigarette marketing evils from air reportedly under tobacco company pressure. Incensed at compromising creative control then denied the opportunity to explain the sudden omission on-air, Tommy and Dick openly revolted reading the corporation's statement of rebuttal next episode in protest. A die now cast irreconcilably, CBS canceled the hugely popular Comedy Hour mid-season after just 2 years bucking the brothers’ lockstep defiance. Their gutsy primetime rebellion breaching establishment barriers suffered martyrdom but sparked a nervous cultural awakening. America increasingly accepted dissenting views through mass media influencing election outcomes and policy shifts that decade. Later Careers Blacklisted after cancellation kept the duo off-air for three years but vivacious Tommy pivoted consulting the rising Vancouver stand-up scene while searching independent film and stage options. In 1973, the Brothers finally returned launching a self-titled NBC summer series but creative disputes prematurely scuttled potential comeback. Tommy retreated from Hollywood disenchanted for a decade nurturing a straight acting career, while slowly rebuilding rapport with estranged former partner Dick through annual concert tours capitalizing on 1960s nostalgia. Like a phoenix from ashes, Tommy Sparked unexpected third-act punchline success by directing comedian David Strathairn’s one man “Call Me Twice” show, launching an explosive career that Smothers helped shape through directing several specials and coaching complex onstage monologues channeling multiple personas. This full-circle mentorship role rejuvenated Tommy’s creative leadership itch so long smothered since his revolutionary small-screen skirmish. Reviving public performance alongside Brother Dick, the two finally mended fences for good by the late 1980s recapturing chemistry that made the Smothers Brothers legendary. Warm tributes followed in the new millennium for groundbreaking legacy advancing social commentary boundaries on network TV through cunning laughter. Though never reluctant rebels, their comedic camouflage Trojan Horse subtly brought down barriers so successors like Saturday Night Live could drive progressive discourse deeper into the American psyche. Tommy Smothers' youthful crusade blazing trail from censorship to consciousness endures decades on as triumph. Thanks for listening to Quiet Please.

2Z22mgLw5XGfHDSQ4RRn0m,KaRi from TPSradio & State of the USPS,"Listen to Interview about USPS on WZRD 88.3 fm radio Chicago Karen M. Nielsen USPS EmployeeAlso see:  UnemployDeJoy.com   and google: Dominick VS Louis DeJoy (The Guardian).   Also IWP DeJoy.Hi I'm KaRi. I started TPSradio in 1999, podcasting Feb 2005. The rage became ""Live Internet TV"" (mogulus, etc.) in 2008 and in 2012 TPS returned to cable access TV.  TPS college radio was heard on campus at CSULB via the internet, live webcast with simultaneous audio broadcast over Community Television. TPSradio also aired on Cerritos and LB City Colleges.TPSradio featured Talent, Products, and Services in The (562).  I read local newspaper headlines, spoke and wrote in dot coms about anything I wanted in ""LBweekly"" in View from the Hill Newspaper.  I micro-distributed the Newspaper (my column had listings of Art Receptions by zip code and and mentioned bands with upcoming gigs you can hear OVER LBCTelevison via Charter and ATT Uverse).  Promoted fundraisers and EXPRESS MAIL, getting things from pt A to pt B (back when it was about $22 but you can't ""sell"" anything on cable access TV).Loved street teaming timeless TPSradio on LBCTelevision postcards with upcoming events on the flipside at the coffee shops (until the franchises stopped doing that one mid-April).. When Community Television went dark in 2008, the FCC linked my website on theirs.  The page it went to had a link to the local cable TV presence I created on youtube with an array of shows produced in LBC.  I worked camera on quite a few but never wanted to be on TV myself.In addition to The Prime Spot radio show heard on cable access TV where I played all genres, my print column, radio show(s) and Live webcast, I created a newsletter that wrote itself.  HOW:  I googled key words ""562"" ""newsletter"" and ""subscribe"" to find the LOCAL newsletters.  Then, instead of subscribing  to each one independently, I subscribed as LBweekly@yahooGROUPS(.com).   So if anyone subscribed to LBweekly(.com) they would get ONE daily email called TPS eNews (The Prime Spot newsletter) which contained all of the other newsletters!I had some other ideas that were really cool and can still work but at that time no one really understood podcasting. I did a few live blues webcasts with a small asus computer from Clancy's downtown; interviewed Leo Laporte at the very first podcast Expo in Ontario CA 2005...CURRENT PROJECT while on hiatus from work:  Get rid of my boss' boss' boss' and retore TRUST IN USPS.  The Best Deal in America was the First Class Letter until the Postal Police were taken off street patrol.  PMG Louis DeJoy started June 2020 and in August ""USPS OIG KEY"" report let the thieves know how easy master keys are to get.Postmaster Louis DeJoy's brother Dominick sued him over messing with his mail and tricking him out of the trucking and delivery business.. Dominick mentioned the Glass-Steagall Act in his book of Love Poems which is odd because that has to do with commercial vs investment banks, when the banks went bust and according to ""About LDJ"" he made millions from the family business by working USPS contracts awarded without competition. ....... Some people think DeJoy is Trump's puppet.  Try the other way around.  With vast international intelligence presence, PMG LDJ has been active with the Institute of World Politics for over a decade.  DeJoy just spoke in March put the contents won't be shared... DO NOT TOUCH MY RETIREMENT OR TSP PLAN!  And remove DeJoy who should have NEVER been hired.  LOOK at all of the news videos on youtube ""Carrier Robbed"" ""Master Key Stolen.""  How many unplanned  babies have been born due to DeJoy's negligence of NOT addressing Customer concerns (delivery of birth control pills).   Postmaster Louis DeJoy is misleading the public about receive items an average of  2.5days WHEN the NON delivered items are not figured into the performance statistics.Get him out!",KaRi from TPSradio + ThePrimeSpot.TV,45,https://open.spotify.com/show/2Z22mgLw5XGfHDSQ4RRn0m,https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6765630000ba8a363dbb6112294d9c69431926

Hon hade hållit på med musik länge men upplevde att det inte gick att komma någonvart. Var det fortfarande värt det eller borde hon byta planer? Frustrationen ledde till att hon skrev ett inlägg i en musikgrupp på Facebook om kulturarbetares orimliga arbetsvillkor, och hon fick ett stort gensvar. ”Äntligen vågar någon uttrycka detta”, skrev någon. En Metoo- rörelse och en Avicii-död senare, och efter att två musiker runt Niina varit nära att gå in i väggen, kände Niina att tiden var mogen för en podcast om hur man förändrar musikbranschen mot jämlikhet, mångfald och schyssta arbetsvillkor.

Episodes conclude with 30 minutes of discussion of current events, Japanese cultural hot takes, and controversial spicy opinions, wrapped in a respectful, ""nihonjin""-focused attitude.Topics can be a bit triggering and often NSFW (naughty, naughty nerds... bad otaku, bad); but the podcast is always a safe space for those looking for a cultural home, LGBTQIA+ safe space, or just a place to weeb out.

Peut-être t’es-tu déjà impliqué·e dans des actions, mais le résultat t’a paru insatisfaisant. Bref, tu aimerais savoir comment agir et t’engager.  Ici, on va se pencher sur ces questions : on ira à la rencontre des personnes qui incarnent les luttes, dans leurs diversités d’être et d’action. On essaiera de comprendre ce qui les anime et pour quoi elles luttent. On souhaite encourager l’engagement, alimenter la réflexion, faire découvrir de nouvelles façons de lutter.
